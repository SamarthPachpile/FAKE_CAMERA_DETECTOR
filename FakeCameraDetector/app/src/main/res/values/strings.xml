        This Application helps you find out if there are fake cameras on your phone or not.
        The number you see below is the number of camera(s) this app could detect. For example
        if there are 4 cameras (including the front camera) on your phone but you see here 3, then
        it means that there is 1(one) fake camera. Since on many device there are many fake cameras just for the style.
        I have tested this app on multiple device so dont worry its works fluid.....
